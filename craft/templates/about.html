          <p class="team-founder-text">Kathryn can thank her grandfather for putting her on her first bike &mdash; though she wasn't so pleased at the time. For her sixth birthday, grandpa gave her a baby blue bike with a banana seat. But she really wanted the one with <a href="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091214022709/strawberryshortcake/images/6/6e/Strawberry-Shortcake-bike-1.jpg" target="_blank">Strawberry Shortcake</a> on it. Growing up on the south side of Milwaukee, she found independence by biking to the beach near her house and later by cycling to her summer job everyday. While studying at London School of Economics, she first conceived of the boot. It also explains the name, which comes from the British term for a car trunk. With the idea still simmering in her mind, Kathryn moved to Boston where she worked in finance (covering oil, of all things) and cultivated a deep love for urban cycling. The Buca Boot is truly her baby, combining her style, her passion, and her pragmatism into a singularly smart product.
